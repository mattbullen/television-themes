# Identifying Thematic Outliers in T.V. News using Google BigQuery and AWS Lambda

Final project for Havard Extension School CSCI E-90, Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things, Fall 2016. 

This is a one page app using Google BigQuery, AWS Lambda, React.js & D3.js, hosted on Heroku. The app identifies outlying persons, themes, and degree of thematic variety in American television news shows. Data is drawn from a [GDELT](http://www.gdeltproject.org/) database.

If you'd like to try the app, please contact me so I can set access permissions; because it uses paid services, access has to be whitelisted.
